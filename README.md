# Reactive Microservice Design [Video]
This is the code repository for [Reactive Microservice Design [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/reactive-microservice-design-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788626378), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Reactive Microservice Designs are flexible, loosely-coupled, and scalable, which makes them easier to develop and amenable to change. They are also highly responsive, giving users effective interactive feedback while applying design principles by displaying properties such as Responsive, Resilient, Elastic, and Message-driven at all levels of scale, making them composable.

This video course will show you how to successfully set up an IDE and use Apache Maven, so that you can begin developing apps using the Eclipse Vert.x platform. Next, it will teach you how to debug and deploy your applications with Docker right within the IDE, before you move on to learn the basics of Microservices and reactive programming. 
Further on, you’ll learn how to build a fake ledger application, where you’ll act as an online bank and handle thousands of transactions in your environment, all while being able to view the state of your application in real-time on your browser. Next, you’ll learn how to make your services discoverable and resilient to failure using service discovery and circuit breaker patterns. Then you’ll see how an unsecure Microservice can be secured with the current state of the art technologies such as JWT and OAuth2. 

Towards the end, we’ll walk you through the differences between JWT and OAuth2 as well the different flows of Oauth2 and how they suit web applications. You’ll then get familiar with authentication and authorization and will write the glue code to your Microservices to implement state of the art security.
