# Eclipse Vert.x Reactive Microservices Tutorial

This document contains the notes for the reactive microservices tutorial. When you checkout the code initially you will
find that the default branch is called "monolith". This is the initial application that does not follow a reactive
microservice architecture that we will refactor.

Most of the code is already provided and there are 13 TODOs that you are required to implement/fix. You can find an
overview of these TODOs on the [github pages link](https://pmlopes.github.io/vertx-reactive-microservices).

If you find youself blocked you can always refer to the branches:

* monolith - this branch
* master - the basic solution
* high-availability - improvements on master to show how the application can be resilient
